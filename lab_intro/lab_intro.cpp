/**
 * Returns an image that has been transformed to grayscale.
 *
 * We are still representing the image using RGBA, but each pixel
 * will be adjusted so that it is a shade of gray with equal RGB values.
 * 
 * Note that while setting each RGB channel to the simple average may seem
 * intuitive, the resulting image will not be visually accurate due to the
 * human eye's varying sensitivity to different wavelengths.
 * Therefore the grayscale value for each channel will instead be weighted
 * by the perceived luminosity as 0.229*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B.
 *
 * Finally, as each channel is stored in a variable of type unsigned char,
 * ensure that the computed grayscale value is truncated to an appropriate
 * value for storage. Also be aware that sufficient precision must be
 * maintained during intermediate computations.
 *
 * @return The grayscale image.
